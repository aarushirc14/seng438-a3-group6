# Introduction
This lab was an extension of the last assignment. We enhanced our unit tests for JFreeChart (the SUT) using coverage tools such as EclEmma. We utilized various white-box testing techniques like control flow coverage (line, branch, method) and data flow coverage by drawing data flow graphs and deriving def-use pairs.

# Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and metrics you report

Aarushi: I used EclEmma for this lab. One of the cons was that I had to change my entire development environment and IDE from VSCode to Eclipse. I discovered VSCode does not offer any good coverage plug-ins on the community version. Once I switched to Eclipse however, using EclEmma was seamless and the integration was smooth. There were no issues with mocking and the test cases from the previous lab that used mocking worked fine with EclEmma. EclEmma shows line/statement, branch and method coverage but is missing condition and path coverage. Lastly, another drawback of EclEmma is that it does not allow you to drill down enough on the generated metrics to find out exactly what was not covered (like which lines of code or branches), this feature would save a lot of time for white-box testers.

Luke: I used Eclipse with EclEmma for this lab. One advantage of this coverage tool was that it was easy to integrate in Eclipse as it has built-in compatibility with JUnit testing. This made the set up progress really easy and minimized the preparation time. With EclEmma, I was able to visualize branch, method, and statement based coverages easily with a percentage indicator.  One disadvantage of this tool was that there were no clear highlights on what specific lines of code in the SUT was being missed. This required more in-depth brainstorming to try and figure out what edge cases may have been missed.

Jonathan: I really appreciated EclEmma during this lab and its feature to highlight when your unit tests cover and do not cover in the DataUtilities and Range class. However, a potential disadvantage of using coverage tools like this is that the unit tests become specifically tailored to the code and branches within the method and testers may focus less on creating edge case tests that the method may expect but the code does not contain. 

Ahsan: Having used EclEmma, I observed the ease of use, specifically the highlighting of the important parts which makes it comprehensive. It has detailed coverage reports that can assist in identifying areas needing to be further tested. Though this was not a large project, EclEmma may end up inefficient for larger projects as they will be quite time-consuming. I further noticed that EclEmma does not work with other programming languages such as c++ and python, and is only limited to Java.



# A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.

Advantages of requirements-based testing:
* Effective for large/complex code segments or methods
* Access to code is not required (black box testing)
* Allows us to identify the differences between the perspectives of users and developers

Disadvantages of requirements-based testing:
* Can be inefficient because testers lack the knowledge about the software’s internal details
* Limited scope and bug discovery as only some scenarios are performed, edge cases may be missed
* Poor documentation on methods and classes can make it difficult to write unit tests

Advantages of coverage-based testing:
* Coverage tools provide testers with easy to analyze and unbiased metrics
* Testers have access to the code so they can use logical reasoning to find bugs and security issues
* Possible to obtain 100% coverage, although this may be inefficient and/or unnecessary 
* Testers gain a better understanding where specific methods and classes are used and their purpose.

Disadvantages of coverage-based testing:
* Does not ensure that the critical sections of the code are being covered by the tests because the coverage too cannot tell which methods/sections are critical to the application’s functionality
* Many coverage tools are available, difficult to decide which is best
* Requires the tester to have extensive knowledge about the SUT
* Requires access to the code 
*Testers may focus more on writing tests regarding code coverage instead of edge cases that the code does not have. 




# A discussion on how the team work/effort was divided and managed

Aarushi: Wrote new test cases or improved previously written ones for these methods- calculateColumnTotal (Values2D data, int column), calculateColumnTotal(Values2D data, int column, int[] validRows), calculateRowTotal(Values2D data, int row), calculateRowTotal(Values2D data,int row,int[] validCols), getLength(), getCentralValue(), min and max. Drew the DFD, derived the def-use pairs and calculated the coverage for calculateColumnTotal (Values2D data, int column).

Luke: Improved old test cases and wrote new ones for the following methods: In DataUtilities; clone and equal. In Range; equals, constrain, intersects, contains, getLowerBound, and getUpperBound.

Jonathan: Improved old test cases and wrote new ones for the following methods: In Data Utilities: getCumulativePercentages, In range: combine , combineIgnoreNaN, Scale, Range, hashcode. Wrote the Manual data flow coverage calc- method getLength method in Range class. 

Ahsan: Improved and wrote new test cases for the following: Data Utilities: createNumberArray, createNumberArray2D. Range: toString, expandToInclude, isNaNRange, shift, and shiftWithNoZeroCrossing

Although we split up testing the methods, in the end we reviewed each other’s unit tests. Overall, we felt the team distributed the work evenly and was effective in finishing it correctly and on time. 



# Any difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned from performing the lab

Aarushi: I learned about different coverage metrics and tried out some coverage tools. Understanding how EclEmma works was challenging at first as I had not used it before. Additionally it was difficult to understand how EclEmma was calculating the coverage values as using the “assignment artifacts” from lab 2 versus lab 3 yielded different values (although the lab manual stated both labs use the same files). I also had to refer to lecture notes and do some online research to make the DFD, find the def-use pairs and calculate the coverage for the calculateColumnTotal method.

Luke: I came across one difficulty while testing the coverage for the getUpperBound() and getLowerBound() methods in the Range class. There is a block of logic that is copied over from the constructor which checks for invalid Range values set by the user (ex: upper bound value is smaller than lower bound value). Because the constructor makes this check, there is no easy way of accessing this block of code in the getLowerBound and getUpperBound methods. I concluded that this is an indicator of bad code design and something engineers would have to address if it was come across in an industry scene. Although coverage is reduced, this line of code is inaccessible in any case.

Jonathan: I came across an issue within the getCumulativePercentages function. Unfortunately the coverage tool states that the test coverage is not above 90%. This is because there is a for loop that is inaccessible due to a bug in the code. The loop goes as follows: 
for (int i2 = 0; i2 > data.getItemCount(); i2++) 
As you can see, in order to go into the loop, data.getItemCount() would have to be negative since i2 = 0. However, if that were the case this would cause an infinite loop since i2 is incrementing and will never be less than data.getItemCount(). One of the things I learned from this and coverage-based testing is that developing unit tests is a very good way of identifying bugs in the code. I also learned that low unit test coverage may not be because of the tester but the individual which developed the code to be tested.  

Ahsan: I faced difficulty in the “shift” method for Range; following further research, I understood and took note of feedback received. EclEmma was a bit confusing to use in the beginning, but quickly adaptable with time. Furthermore, in terms of difficulty, this assignment would be considered a lot more than the previous one. Nonetheless, a great way to exercise testing practices.




# Comments/feedback on the lab itself

Aarushi: Overall an interesting lab but the lab document could have provided more clear instructions, in terms of whether we had to improve just the test cases we wrote in the last lab or test all the methods in both classes.

Luke: The lab itself was useful as we got to see how much coverage our existing tests were giving. Although, I wish that the lab instructions were clearer with more visuals. It helped me visualize how well my tests were performing beyond a validity stand point.

Jonathan: I found the lab and coverage-based testing to be a lot more effective than the previous since allowing us to see the code made it much easier to understand a method's purpose and functionality and identify potential unit tests. 

Ahsan: Building up on the second assignment, I found it to be quite helpful following the instructions which were very clear. Overall, it took more understanding and work in comparison to the first two labs, which in turn helped us improve our software testing capabilities.
